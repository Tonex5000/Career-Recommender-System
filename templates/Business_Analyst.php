							<p style="font-size:16px;" >Business analysts help guide businesses in improving processes, products, services, and software through data analysis. These agile workers straddle the line between IT and business to help bridge the gap and improve efficiency.</p>

							<p style="font-size:16px;">BAs are responsible for creating new models that support business decisions by working closely with financial reporting and IT teams to establish initiatives and strategies to improve importing and to optimize costs. You’ll need a “strong understanding of regulatory and reporting requirements as well as plenty of experience in forecasting, budgeting, and financial analysis combined with understanding of key performance indicators,” according to Robert Half Technology.</p>

                            <p style="font-size:16px;">The role of a business analyst is constantly evolving and changing — especially as companies rely more on data to advise business operations. Every company has different issues that a business analyst can address, whether it’s dealing with outdated legacy systems, changing technologies, broken processes, poor client or customer satisfaction, or siloed large organizations.</p>

							<h2>Skills required</h2>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">The business analyst position requires both hard skills and soft skills. Business analysts need to know how to pull, analyze, and report data trends and be able to share that information with others and apply it on the business side. Not all business analysts need a background in IT as long as they have a general understanding of how systems, products, and tools work. Alternatively, some business analysts have a strong IT background and less experience in business and are interested in shifting away from IT to this hybrid role.</p>
